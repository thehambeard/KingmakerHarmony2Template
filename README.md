# KingmakerHarmony2Template
A template for making mods for Pathfinder Kingmaker using Harmony 2.0 with the helpers.cs from COTW/EA.<br>
Depends upon [KingmakerModMaker](https://github.com/lucianposton/KingmakerModMaker), this is the correct version as it uses harmony 2.0<br>
This only includes the helpers and all COTW specific code has been removed.<br>
If you wish to build upon COTW then install it, and reference Holic92's mod.<br>
Thanks to Holic92, Spacehamster, Tyrir, Brrainz, lucianposton, and Jennifer Messerly
