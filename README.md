## KingmakerHarmony2Template
# 1.1
- Updated to remove obsolete harmony library methods
# 1.0
- A template for making mods for Pathfinder Kingmaker using Harmony 2.0 with the helpers.cs from COTW/EA.
- Depends upon [KingmakerModMaker](https://github.com/lucianposton/KingmakerModMaker), this is the correct version as it uses harmony 2.0
- This only includes the helpers and all COTW specific code has been removed.
- If you wish to build upon COTW then install it, and reference Holic92's mod.
- Thanks to Holic92, Spacehamster, Tyrir, Brrainz, lucianposton, and Jennifer Messerly
